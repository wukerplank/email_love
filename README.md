# eMail Love

This is a small script that POPs a Gmail account extracts the HTML part of an email and forwards it to somebody.

The purpose is to debug HTML emails generated by MailChimp and comparable services. They do some inlining magic and this script trys to help you bust through.

## Installation & Usage

Simply clone this script and run `bundle install`. Typically you will set up a dedicated account that receives the emails (e.g. `emaillove@yourcompany.com`). Edit `config.yml` and add the Gmail credentials.

Then edit `users.yml` and add a user, e.g.:

    ---
      john: joh@appleseed.com

After that you can send an email to `emaillove+john@yourcompany.com` and John will receive an email with an HTML attachment shortly after that â€“ easy!
